# NPS-Essential-Traveler-Information

### Project Summary

In 2016, NPS and USDOT Volpe Center created the [NPS National Long Range Transportation Plan (NLRTP)](https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/32531). This effort proposed a number of goals, objectives, and performance measures that would support the 20-year strategic direction and planning of NPS national parks and other public lands.

One goal area is to maintain and enhance the quality of visitor experience. The objectives under this goal are:
- Improve ease of access to and within national park units for all people
- Create a range of appropriate transportation options that support a network of seamless connections within each park unit and to surrounding communities
- Provide state-of-the-art traveler information and wayfinding and, where appropriate, interpretation and education opportunities that complement transportation options

NPS park unit websites can have major influence on visitors and their planning for visiting a park. NPS created nine essential pieces of traveler information that answer important questions for some groups of visitors (i.e. where is the parking? How do I get to the major sites? Can I take public transportation? Is it accessible?)
